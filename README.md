<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Using Jupyter & Python, the report is a culmination of data retrieved from past contributors of the project. Their codes were then modified to fit into two distinct reports within one Jupyter notebook. The topics were: 1) An analysis of Australia's National conversation based on news headlines over the past decades and 2) Mental Health within the IT industry.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Snapshots of the report:

1. National conversation is a crucial aspect for nation building. However, there is a lack of data to which topics merit debate. Today, we look into news topics from the past decades and decipher how it possibly contributes to the national convesation.
