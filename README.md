## Usage

Snapshots of the report:

  <h3 align="center">Report #1: National Conversation Based on News headlines</h3>

1.1 National conversation is a crucial aspect for nation building. However, there is a lack of data to which topics merit debate. Today, we look into news topics from the past decades and decipher how it possibly contributes to the national convesation.

1.3 After assigning keyword values to the national headline topics using ReGex, we created a linechart to compare the different topics over time. Keypoints were also addressed for the study.

  <h3 align="center">Report #2: Mental Health illnesses by country and age</h3>


2.1 According to the WHO, mental health is about the state of a person's wellness rather than an illness. There is no official international "guideline" on how to tackle mental health issues and each country addresses its own problems uniquely. We look into the mental health illness distribution by country and age.

2.2 From the graph we could see that the USA was leading in terms of mental ilnesses over other industrialized countries.

2.3 After further breakdown the data into frequency based on ages and location, we have come into conclusion that those between the ages of 35-54 are the most vulnerable to mental health issues.
